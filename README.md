As a soon-to-be Master's graduate in Cyber Security and a Bachelor's degree holder in Computer Science, I possess a solid foundation in the theoretical and practical aspects of computer systems and cybersecurity principles. With a strong background in programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering, I have developed a passion for protecting digital assets and ensuring the integrity of computer systems. Through my academic and professional journey, I have gained expertise in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, incident response, and security research. I am excited to bring my skills and knowledge to a dynamic and innovative environment, where I can contribute to the development of cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions and stay ahead of the evolving threats in the cyber world.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has fueled my passion for cybersecurity, and I now aspire to transition into a career in penetration testing. My goal is to join a team as a Junior Penetration Tester, where I can utilize my skills to simulate attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and help organizations strengthen their defenses.
